# MongoDB Oplog to SQL Parser exercise

This exercise involves creating a program which parses MongoDB operations log (oplog) and generate equivalent SQL statements

This exercise has been solved in a TDD fashion. Please refer to the execise [here](https://one2n.io/go-bootcamp/go-projects/mongodb-oplog-to-sql-parser/mongodb-oplog-to-sql-parser-exercise).


## Progress till date
Finished till story 8, that is, reading oplogs from a file.

## Remarks
Currently, the program is unsuitable for continuous operation due to the inability to share cache across multiple oplogs. This issue needs to be addressed before proceeding further.
